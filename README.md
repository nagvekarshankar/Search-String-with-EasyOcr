## Business Problem
 In the real world, most of the time we have encountered different forms of images. It can be regular, irregular images along with text format within   it. It is a challenging task to search any string from them.
     So, We have taken few images and extract text from given images and search the desired strings.

##  Solution
   We would be using EasyOCR to detect and extract Text from given images.
   EasyOCR supports 80+ differnt languages and all popular writing scripts including: Latin, Chinese, Arabic, Devanagari, Cyrillic, etc.

Detection execution uses the CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection) algorithm
